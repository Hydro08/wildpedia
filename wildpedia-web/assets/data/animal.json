      "description": "The Colugo is a nocturnal mammal known for its ability to glide between trees using a wide membrane of skin called a patagium that stretches from its neck to its tail. It has large eyes for seeing in the dark and soft, brown or gray fur that blends with tree bark. Colugos spend most of their lives in trees, feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruits.",
      "trivia": "The Colugo is often called the “flying lemur,” but it's not actually a lemur and cannot truly fly—it only glides. It's also the closest living relative to primates, making it an important species for studying evolution. Despite its small size, a Colugo can glide over 100 meters in a single leap between trees.",

Its striking appearance, with black-tipped wings and a dark tail band, makes it one of the most recognizable birds in the tropical forests of the Americas. This hawk spends much of its time perched silently on tall trees, scanning the ground for movement. When it spots potential prey usually small mammals, lizards, snakes, or large insects it dives swiftly with incredible precision.",
        "Despite its predatory nature, the White Hawk moves gracefully through the forest canopy, often gliding smoothly in the warm air currents. It is a solitary bird but may sometimes be seen soaring in pairs, especially during the breeding season. The species prefers quiet, humid areas where it can hunt effectively while staying hidden among the leaves. Its calm and observant nature, combined with its snow-white plumage, gives it an almost angelic presence in the wild."

For example, individuals in the Amazon tend to have darker underparts, while those from Central America appear almost completely white.",
